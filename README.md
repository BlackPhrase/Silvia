# SILVIA - A Miniature Game Framework

Middle part between game and engine

## General

This is a middleware software that connects a game engine to a game code  
This allows game developers to write game code which will be independent from 
the engine it will be powered by and allows to easily swap one engine with 
another with less to no effort by simply using/writing a set of engine-specific 
interface implementations that'll do the actual work
